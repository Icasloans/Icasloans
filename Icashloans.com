The Pew Charitable Trusts today released a report detailing fraudulent and abusive practices associated with payday loans offered online. The study found that Internet loans are more expensive than those offered through storefronts; that they are designed to promote renewals and long-term indebtedness; that many online borrowers report being threatened by lenders or debt collectors; and that the vast majority of payday borrower complaints are about online loans. Pew calls on federal regulators to address these problems by establishing strong, clear, and consistent consumer protections for the small-dollar lending market as a whole.
